2022-10-21, 6:03â€¯p.m. - Gavin Acquroff: I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we shop:
- transportation: we can use Evo to bring things back to my house before Nov. 1 or we can use the Uhaul on Nov. 1. To hold an item until Nov.1, we might need to pay in advance which is a bit risky. If picking up Nov.1, will want to find items that are close together or near the apartment, to save time and gas money. E.g. Richmond is pretty far. If we pick items up earlier, we will need to consider storage and whether it can fit in an evo, as well as the costs of the evo.
